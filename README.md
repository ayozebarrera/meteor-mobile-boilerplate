meteor-mobile-boilerplate
=========================

A lightweight starter for mobile web, cordova, phonegap. Preview: [mobile-boilerplate.meteor.com](http://mobile-boilerplate.meteor.com)

**Note this is a work in progress and will be changing heavily over the next few weeks.**   
I'm pulling a lot of code
from [blonk](http://blonk.co) and refactoring things that need cleaned up. This will utilize more of the new Meteor
UI components.


### ToDo

- Finish header
- Basic header button set
- Scroll view
- Table views (several cell types)
- Tray for prefs/options
- Animations
- Tab bar
- Android overrides for a more native feel on Android
